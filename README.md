#  BioMedGPT: AI-Driven Drug Discovery Platform

BioMedGPT is an end-to-end AI system designed to generate, optimize, and evaluate novel drug-like molecules using a combination of generative deep learning models, graph neural networks (GNNs), and reinforcement learning.

The system aims to automate de novo drug design, where the objective is to create entirely new molecular structures with desired biochemical properties — such as high solubility, low toxicity, and strong binding affinity to disease-relevant proteins (e.g., cancer targets).

Inspired by breakthroughs like AlphaFold and DiffDock, BioMedGPT goes beyond simple property prediction — it actively designs new candidate molecules that could function as future drugs, tailored to specific protein targets.
